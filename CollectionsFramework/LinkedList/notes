 LinkedList
 It consists of a list of nodes.
 It contains a reference to the next node.
 it can hold any kind of data type, object

 Memory is expensive
 To add a node, you need to create the node and then point the references in list
 Similar to an ArrayList, as they both implement List interface, which allows to add, change, remove and items from a list in the same way.
 Their main difference is the way they were built.
 
 How the LinkedList works
 The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.


 When To Use
 Use an ArrayList for storing and accessing data, and LinkedList to manipulate data.
