Sets

An interface with no duplicates
It includes HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet(which derived from interface SortedSet). A TreeSet gives you order(backed by TreeMap), HashSet is backed by HashMap and does not maintain order.
Methaphor: think of it as a bag with balls of different colors; you dont know in what order they will be, but they will all be unique.
More formally, sets contain no pair of elements e1 and e2, such that e1.equals(e2); and at most one null element.
There are methods under the hood that check if elements are equal; and ignores them.

Methods 
add() to add items
contains() to check whether an item exists in HashSet
remove() to remove an item
clear() to remove all items
size() to get size


Loop Through a HashSet

Loop through the items of an HashSet with a for-each loop:
Example
for (String i : cars) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
