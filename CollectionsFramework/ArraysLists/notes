ArrayList

Benefits of an ArrayList:
- not fixed in size
- allows duplicates
- backed by an array
- fast for data retrieval
- ordered collection

How the ArrayList works

The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed into the array. If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.

When To Use
 Use an ArrayList for storing and accessing data, and LinkedList to manipulate data.
